# pr-vibe v0.7.0 Development Session Summary

## User Feedback Addressed

The user reported that while pr-vibe correctly identified no actionable items in PR #61, it could be enhanced to provide better visibility. We implemented all four suggestions:

### 1. ‚úÖ Better Categorization
- Added priority levels: `MUST_FIX`, `SUGGESTION`, `NITPICK`
- Every comment now includes priority in its analysis
- Clear distinction between critical and optional items

### 2. ‚úÖ Show Non-Critical Suggestions
- Added `--show-all` flag to CLI
- Non-critical items tracked separately in reports
- Shows count of hidden suggestions when not using --show-all

### 3. ‚úÖ Bot Approval Summary
- New bot approval tracking system
- Shows which bots approved the PR
- Displays breakdown: "3 suggestions, 2 nitpicks"
- Clear indication of bot verdicts

### 4. ‚úÖ PR URL in Output
- PR URL displayed at top of analysis

## Key Learnings

1. **User feedback was spot-on** - The enhancements significantly improve the UX
2. **Categorization matters** - Users need to know what's critical vs optional
3. **Progressive disclosure works** - Show important info by default, details on demand
4. **Bot approvals are valuable** - Quick summary helps users understand PR status

## Next Steps

1. Resolve npm publish issue (manual publish if needed)
2. Monitor user feedback on new features
3. Consider adding filtering by priority level
4. Potential for custom priority mappings per project
