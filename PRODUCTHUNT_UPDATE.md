No tokens. No signup. No BS. Just instant value in 10 seconds.

pr-vibe is the first tool built BY an AI (Claude) FOR AI collaboration. When CodeRabbit and Claude Code work together on your PRs, magic happens.

**The Problem:**
- CodeRabbit: "Remove console.log" (for the 100th time)
- You: "It's for CloudWatch..." (for the 100th time)
- 20 minutes wasted. Every. Single. PR.

**The Solution:**
pr-vibe learns YOUR patterns and handles repetitive feedback automatically:
- âœ… Auto-fixes security issues
- âœ… Explains your valid patterns
- âœ… Learns from every decision
- âœ… Saves 18+ minutes per PR

**What's Different:**
- ðŸš€ **Zero Setup Demo** - Try before you authenticate
- ðŸ§  **Smart Auth** - Finds your GitHub token automatically
- ðŸŽµ **AI Harmony** - Built for AI-to-AI collaboration
- âš¡ **95% Automation** - After just 10 PRs

Built during a real PR with 19 bot comments. Now saving teams hours every week.
