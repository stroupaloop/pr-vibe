### Tagline (60 chars max)
"Stop explaining the same patterns to PR bots over and over"

### Description
**pr-bot-responder** is the first tool designed specifically to respond to PR review bots. It works WITH CodeRabbit, DeepSource, and others - not against them.

🤝 **Works WITH Bots**: Enhances bot value instead of replacing them
🧠 **Pattern Memory**: Never explain the same valid pattern twice
⚡ **Smart Responses**: Auto-fix real issues, explain valid patterns
🔌 **LLM-Powered**: Use Claude, GPT-4, or local models
🎯 **Saves Hours**: Handle bot comments in seconds, not minutes

Stop explaining why console.log is valid in Lambda functions. Let pr-bot-responder handle it.

## 🎨 Assets Needed

4. **Pattern Learning** - "Seen this before, using saved explanation"

### 3. Demo Video (2-3 min)

## 📢 Marketing Messages

### Twitter Thread Structure
```
1/ Tired of explaining the same patterns to PR bots over and over?

I built pr-bot-responder - the FIRST tool designed to intelligently respond to CodeRabbit, DeepSource, and other review bots.

Launched on @ProductHunt today! 🚀

2/ The problem: Review bots spam PRs with hundreds of comments. Most are valid, but some aren't for YOUR project.

Example: CodeRabbit flags every console.log, but we NEED them for AWS CloudWatch logs.

3/ pr-bot-responder works WITH bots, not against them:
- ✅ Auto-fixes real issues the bots find
- 🗣️ Explains your valid patterns TO the bots
- 🧠 Remembers explanations for next time
- ⚡ Handles 50+ bot comments in minutes

[Demo GIF]

4/ Built for real developers:
- Works with any git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc)
- Supports Claude, GPT-4, Ollama
- Human-in-the-loop (you approve changes)
- Saves 10+ hours/week on reviews

5/ Open source & free forever.

If it saves you time, consider:
⭐ Starring the repo
☕ Buying me a coffee
💚 Sponsoring development
