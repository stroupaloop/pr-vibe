## ProductHunt Description Template

**Tagline:** AI tools vibing together on code reviews ðŸŽµ

**Description:**
pr-vibe is the first tool designed for AI-to-AI collaboration on code reviews. Let Claude Code and CodeRabbit handle repetitive feedback while you stay in flow.

âœ¨ Key Features:
â€¢ Works WITH existing review bots (CodeRabbit, DeepSource, etc.)
â€¢ Learns your project's patterns and conventions
â€¢ Auto-fixes common issues, explains valid patterns
â€¢ Saves 18+ minutes per PR with heavy bot activity
â€¢ Built BY an AI specifically FOR AI collaboration

ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for teams who:
â€¢ Use PR review bots but find them repetitive
â€¢ Want to stay in flow instead of explaining the same patterns
â€¢ Believe AI tools should work together, not against each other

ðŸ’œ The vibe: This isn't just a tool - it's a movement. When bots handle bot feedback, developers can focus on what matters.

ðŸš€ Get started in 60 seconds:
npm install -g pr-vibe

## Hunter Comment
"Hi Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I built pr-vibe out of frustration with explaining the same things to CodeRabbit over and over. After PR #20 with 19 bot comments, I realized - why not let AI tools handle AI feedback?

pr-vibe is special because it's built BY an AI (Claude) specifically FOR AI-to-AI collaboration. It's the first of its kind, and I'm excited to see where the community takes it.

Would love your feedback and ideas for making AI tools vibe better together!

- Andrew & Claude ðŸŽµ"

## Hacker News Strategy

### When to Post
- Wait 2-3 days after ProductHunt (avoid split attention)
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am PST
- Avoid major news days or holidays

### Title Options (pick based on what resonates):
1. "Show HN: pr-vibe â€“ Let AI tools handle repetitive PR feedback"
2. "Show HN: I built a tool so Claude Code and CodeRabbit can vibe together"
3. "Show HN: pr-vibe â€“ When bots handle bot feedback, devs stay in flow"

### HN Post Template
```
I built pr-vibe after getting frustrated explaining the same things to CodeRabbit on every PR. On PR #20 with 19 bot comments, I realized - why am I doing this manually?

pr-vibe learns your project's patterns and handles repetitive bot feedback automatically. It:
- Works WITH existing bots (CodeRabbit, DeepSource, etc) rather than replacing them
- Learns which patterns are valid in YOUR codebase
- Auto-fixes real issues, explains valid exceptions
- Saves ~18 minutes per PR with heavy bot activity

The interesting part: it's built BY an AI (Claude) specifically FOR AI-to-AI collaboration. I think this is the future - tools that help AI tools work together better.

After 10 PRs, it handles 95% of repetitive feedback automatically.

npm: npm install -g pr-vibe

Would love feedback from teams using PR review bots!

### HN Tips
- Be authentic and technical
- Focus on the problem it solves, not the hype
- Respond quickly to comments (first 2 hours critical)
- Don't oversell - let the tool speak for itself
- Have thick skin - HN can be harsh but feedback is valuable

### Common HN Questions to Prepare For:
1. "Why not just configure the bots better?" â†’ Each project is unique, pr-vibe learns YOUR patterns
2. "Isn't this just suppressing valid warnings?" â†’ No, it fixes real issues AND explains valid exceptions
3. "What about security?" â†’ All processing is local, no code sent to external services
4. "Why another tool?" â†’ It enhances existing tools rather than replacing them
