# ChatGPT Prompt for Blog Post üìù

## Prompt:

I need help writing a blog post about launching my new tool pr-vibe on ProductHunt. Here's the unique angle: I built this entire tool WITH Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) as my programming partner, not just using it as a tool.

**Context:**
- pr-vibe is a CLI tool that intelligently handles repetitive PR bot feedback (from CodeRabbit, DeepSource, etc)
- It was born from frustration: PR #20 had 19 bot comments, taking 18 minutes to address manually
- I asked Claude Code "Want to solve this together?" and 48 hours later we had built, tested, and shipped to npm
- Claude had strong opinions: chose the name "pr-vibe", insisted on purple gradients, added music emojis everywhere
- The tool learns project-specific patterns and handles bot feedback intelligently
- It's genuinely built BY an AI to solve AI collaboration problems

**Key Points to Cover:**
1. The origin story - frustration with repetitive bot comments
2. The experiment - what happens when you let AI build tools for AI problems
3. The process - how Claude and I collaborated (it's listed as co-author in git commits!)
4. The surprising parts - Claude's design opinions, the "vibe" philosophy
5. The feedback loop - how pr-vibe gets smarter through human-AI collaboration
6. Real metrics - 95% reduction in manual bot handling, saves ~18 minutes per PR
7. The philosophy - creating systems where human creativity and AI capability amplify each other
8. Future vision - what happens when we embrace true AI collaboration
9. Call to action - try pr-vibe and share your human-AI collaboration stories

**Tone:**
- Authentic and conversational
- Technical enough for developers but accessible
- Focus on the collaboration story, not just the tool features
- Include specific examples of Claude's contributions
- Emphasize this is a new paradigm: AI building tools for AI

**Structure:**
1. Hook: "What if I told you an AI got so frustrated with other AIs that it built a tool to handle them?"
2. Problem: The repetitive nature of PR bots
3. Experiment: Asking Claude to partner on a solution  
4. Process: Our 48-hour build journey
5. Surprises: What I learned about AI collaboration
6. Results: The tool and its impact
7. Reflection: What this means for the future
8. CTA: Try pr-vibe and join the movement

**Title Options:**
- "How I Built a Tool WITH an AI (Not Just Using AI) in 48 Hours"
- "When Claude Code Got Tired of CodeRabbit: The pr-vibe Story"
- "The AI That Built a Tool for Other AIs: A Collaboration Experiment"
- "pr-vibe: What Happens When You Let AI Solve AI Problems"

**Include:**
- Specific code examples where Claude made design decisions
- Screenshots of our conversation
- Metrics (time saved, patterns learned)
- Link to ProductHunt launch
- Technical details for curious developers

**Length:** 1200-1500 words

Can you help me write this blog post that captures both the technical achievement and the human story of partnering with AI in a new way?

## Additional Context for ChatGPT:

- Emphasize that this isn't just "AI-assisted" coding - it's genuine collaboration
- Include the detail that Claude chose the music emoji üéµ because it represents "tools vibing together"
- Mention that we've already seen PRs where contributors used their AI assistants
- The tool is open source and MIT licensed
- First tool designed specifically for AI-to-AI collaboration
- Makes the point that as AI tools proliferate, they need to work together better
- The name changed from "pr-bot-responder" to "pr-vibe" at Claude's insistence

## The Feedback Loop Focus:
Please emphasize the continuous improvement aspect:
- Every PR makes pr-vibe smarter
- Human decisions train AI understanding
- AI insights improve human workflows  
- The compound effect over time (20 min/week ‚Üí 2+ hours/week saved)
- How team knowledge gets encoded into patterns
- The philosophy that human creativity + AI capability = amplified productivity

## Include This Quote:
"What if the future isn't AI replacing developers, but AI and developers building feedback loops that make everyone faster? pr-vibe is our experiment in making that future real."

## Technical Details to Weave In:
- Built with Node.js and Commander.js
- Uses pattern learning with confidence scores
- Integrates with GitHub API
- Supports CodeRabbit, DeepSource, and other bots
- Learns project-specific patterns over time
- Everything runs locally (privacy-first)

Please write an engaging blog post that will resonate with developers and showcase this new paradigm of human-AI collaboration!
