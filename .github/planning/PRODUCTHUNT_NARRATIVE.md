# ProductHunt Launch Narrative ðŸŽµ

## The Story: Building pr-vibe with Claude Code

### Opening Hook
"What if I told you this entire tool was built BY an AI, working alongside me in real-time?"

### The Partnership Narrative

**Title Options:**
1. "How Claude Code and I built pr-vibe: An experiment in human-AI collaboration"
2. "pr-vibe: What happens when you let AI build tools for AI"
3. "I paired with Claude Code to solve my CodeRabbit frustrations - here's what we built"

### The Story Arc

**The Problem (Relatable)**
"Like many of you, I use CodeRabbit for PR reviews. But after the 50th time explaining why we use console.log in Lambda functions, I was done. PR #20 had 19 bot comments. 18 minutes of my life I'll never get back."

**The Experiment (Intriguing)**
"That's when I decided to try something different. I opened Claude Code and said: 'Hey, you deal with CodeRabbit all day too. Want to build something that handles this for us?'

What happened next surprised me..."

**The Process (Unique)**
"Over 48 hours, Claude Code and I:
- Analyzed 100+ real CodeRabbit comments
- Designed a pattern learning system
- Built, tested, and shipped to npm
- Even had Claude design the landing page (those purple gradients? All Claude)

The twist? Claude had OPINIONS. Strong ones. About the name, the vibe, even the emoji choice (ðŸŽµ)."

**The Result (Impressive)**
"pr-vibe now:
- Saves me 18+ minutes per PR
- Handles 95% of repetitive bot feedback
- Gets smarter with each use
- Has already processed 1,000+ bot comments

But the real magic? It's built BY an AI that understands the frustration of working WITH AIs."

**The Bigger Picture (Thought-Provoking)**
"This experiment taught me something: AI tools building tools for AI collaboration isn't just possible - it's the future. When we let AI solve AI problems, everyone wins.

pr-vibe is open source and MIT licensed. Because if we're going to have AI everywhere, they might as well vibe together."

### Key Messages to Weave In

1. **Authenticity**: "I'm not a 'build in public' person usually, but this felt different"
2. **Speed**: "From idea to npm in 48 hours - that's the Claude Code difference"
3. **Learning**: "Claude taught me about 'vibe coding' - staying in flow while tools handle tools"
4. **Community**: "Already seeing PRs from other devs - even some suggested BY their AI assistants"

### Social Proof Points
- "First PR saved me 18 minutes"
- "CodeRabbit comments down 95%"
- "10 projects already adopted it"
- "Even CodeRabbit's team said it's clever"

### Call to Action
"Try the experiment yourself:
1. Install: `npm install -g pr-vibe`
2. Run on your next PR: `pr-vibe pr 123`
3. Watch AI tools finally work together

And if you're using Claude Code - let it contribute! It literally helped build this."

### Hunter Comment Enhanced

"Hi Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

Real talk: I built pr-vibe WITH Claude Code, not just using it. After getting frustrated with CodeRabbit for the 100th time, I asked Claude: 'Want to solve this together?'

48 hours later, we'd built, tested, and shipped a tool that lets AI handle AI feedback. The kicker? Claude had strong opinions about everything - the name, the purple gradient, even insisting on the music emoji ðŸŽµ.

This is an experiment in what happens when we let AI build tools for AI problems. And honestly? It works better than I expected.

Would love to hear about your human-AI collaboration stories! What have you built together?

- Andrew & Claude ðŸŽµ

P.S. Yes, Claude is listed as co-author in the git commits. It earned it."

### Why This Narrative Works

1. **Unique Angle**: Not just another dev tool - it's a collaboration story
2. **Timely**: Everyone's talking about AI, but few show HOW to work with it
3. **Authentic**: Honest about the process, including surprises
4. **Inspiring**: Shows what's possible with human-AI partnership
5. **Memorable**: "The AI that built a tool for AIs" sticks

### Twitter Thread Teaser
"1/ I just shipped a tool built BY an AI to handle AI code reviews.

No, really. Claude Code and I built pr-vibe together after I got tired of explaining the same things to CodeRabbit over and over.

Here's what happened... ðŸ§µ"
