> üéµ When AI tools vibe together on your PRs. Let CodeRabbit and Claude Code handle the repetitive feedback while you ship features.

Built BY an AI (Claude) FOR AIs to orchestrate - the first tool designed for AI-to-AI collaboration on code reviews.

## Demo

```bash
# Try instantly without any setup!
npx pr-vibe@latest demo
```

Visit our [interactive demo](https://stroupaloop.github.io/pr-vibe/) to see pr-vibe in action.

## Why pr-vibe?

PR review bots like CodeRabbit and DeepSource are great, but they don't understand *your* project. You find yourself:
- Explaining why `console.log` is valid in Lambda functions... again
- Rejecting the same "any types" warnings for complex webhooks
- Manually fixing the same security issues they flag
- Waiting for bot responses and handling rate limits

pr-vibe bridges this gap by:
- ü§ù **Working WITH bots** - Enhances CodeRabbit, DeepSource, etc. rather than replacing them
- üí¨ **Full Conversations** - Handles multi-round dialogues until resolution
- üß† **Learning your patterns** - Remembers your project's conventions and valid exceptions
- ‚ö° **Automating responses** - Fixes what should be fixed, explains what's intentional
- üéØ **Saving time** - Handle bot comments in seconds, not minutes

## Features

- üöÄ **Zero-Setup Demo** - Try instantly with `npx pr-vibe@latest demo`
- üí¨ **Full Conversation Support** - Handles multi-round dialogues with bots, including rate limits
- üîê **Smart Auth Detection** - Finds GitHub tokens from gh CLI, env vars, VS Code automatically
- üîç **Bot Comment Analysis** - Parses and understands comments from all major PR review bots
- üõ†Ô∏è **Smart Actions** - Auto-fix simple issues, explain valid patterns, or escalate edge cases
- üß† **Project Memory** - Learns and remembers your project-specific patterns
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Rate Limit Handling** - Detects and waits for bot rate limits automatically
- üîå **LLM Flexibility** - Works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or without any LLM
- ‚ö° **CLI First** - Full control with human-in-the-loop design

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g pr-vibe

# Or use directly with npx
npx pr-vibe review 42
```

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Try the Demo (No Setup Required!)

```bash
npx pr-vibe@latest demo
```

### Option 2: Quick Start (60 seconds)

1. **Install pr-vibe globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pr-vibe
   ```

2. **Check authentication status:**
   ```bash
   pr-vibe auth
   ```
   
   pr-vibe will automatically detect GitHub tokens from:
   - GitHub CLI (`gh auth token`)
   - Environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`)
   - VS Code GitHub extension
   - Git config
   
   > **üîê Security Note**: Never commit tokens to the repository. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for best practices.

3. **Initialize in your project:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   pr-vibe init
   ```

4. **Review your next PR with bot comments:**
   ```bash
   pr-vibe pr 42
   ```

That's it! pr-vibe will analyze bot comments, handle conversations, and start learning your patterns.

## Commands

```bash
# Interactive demo - no setup required!
pr-vibe demo

# Check authentication status
pr-vibe auth

# Initialize patterns in your project
pr-vibe init

# Review bot comments interactively
pr-vibe pr 42

# Export comments for external analysis (Claude Code mode)
pr-vibe export 42

# Apply decisions from Claude Code
pr-vibe apply 42

# Specify a different repository
pr-vibe pr 42 -r owner/repo

# Show what's new
pr-vibe changelog

# Check for updates
pr-vibe update
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetches** bot comments from your PR (CodeRabbit, DeepSource, etc.)
2. **Analyzes** each comment with pattern matching and optional LLM
3. **Suggests** actions: fix, explain, defer, or escalate
4. **Handles** full conversations including follow-ups and rate limits
5. **Learns** from your decisions to get smarter over time
6. **Saves** you 20+ minutes per PR with heavy bot activity

## Pattern Learning

pr-vibe gets smarter with each use. When you reject a bot suggestion as valid for your project, pr-vibe remembers:

```yaml
# .pr-bot/patterns.yml
valid_patterns:
  - id: console-log-lambda
    pattern: "console.log"
    condition:
      files: ["**/lambda/**", "**/*-handler.js"]
    reason: "We use console.log for CloudWatch logging"
    confidence: 1.0
```

## LLM Integration (Optional)

Enhance pr-vibe with LLM analysis:

```bash
# Use Claude (recommended)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
pr-vibe pr 42 --llm anthropic

# Use GPT-4
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key  
pr-vibe pr 42 --llm openai

# No LLM needed - pattern matching works great!
pr-vibe pr 42
```

## Conversation Management

pr-vibe now handles full conversations with bots:

- **Waits for bot responses** instead of assuming completion
- **Detects rate limits** and waits appropriately
- **Handles corrections** when bots clarify misunderstandings
- **Resolves threads** automatically when consensus is reached
- **Escalates to humans** after too many rounds

Example conversation flow:
```
You: "This is intentional for CloudWatch"
Bot: "Actually, I was referring to the ESLint issue..."
pr-vibe: "Thank you for the clarification. You're right about the ESLint configuration..."
Bot: "LGTM! Thanks for addressing this."
[Thread resolved automatically]
```

## CLI Workflow Example

```bash
# Morning: New PR from your teammate
$ pr-vibe pr 147
üîç Found 12 bot comments from CodeRabbit

Bot: "Missing null check on user.email"
> What would you like to do?
  ‚úì Apply fix
  
Bot: "console.log found in production code"  
> What would you like to do?
  ‚úì Post reply: "We use console.log for CloudWatch"
  
[pr-vibe detects rate limit from CodeRabbit]
‚è≥ Rate limit detected. Waiting 60 seconds...

[After bot responds with clarification]
üí¨ CodeRabbit: "Thanks for the explanation. Makes sense for Lambda!"
‚úÖ Thread resolved automatically

Summary: Fixed 8 issues, explained 3 patterns, skipped 1
Time saved: ~22 minutes
```

## Advanced Features

### Export Mode for Claude Code

Perfect for AI-powered development workflows:

```bash
# Export PR comments for Claude Code analysis
pr-vibe export 42 --format claude

# Creates a markdown report optimized for LLM analysis
```

### Team Patterns (Experimental)

Learn from human reviews too:

```bash
pr-vibe pr 42 --experimental

# Now tracks patterns from senior developers
# "When Alice requests a refactor, it's usually about service boundaries"
# "Bob always flags missing integration tests"
```

## Project Philosophy

pr-vibe embodies "vibe coding" - the idea that AI tools should work together harmoniously. Instead of fighting with bots or explaining the same patterns repeatedly, let pr-vibe orchestrate the conversation while you focus on building great software.

This tool was born from real frustration during PR reviews and built by Claude while actually responding to CodeRabbit comments. It's uniquely positioned to understand the AI-to-AI collaboration space because it emerged from that exact use case.
