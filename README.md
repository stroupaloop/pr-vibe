- üí¨ **Conversational** - Maintains thread context across multiple exchanges  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Smart Actions** - Auto-fix simple issues, discuss complex ones, or escalate when needed

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g pr-review-assistant

# Or use directly with npx
npx pr-review-assistant pr 42
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize in your project
pr-review init

# Review a PR interactively
pr-review pr 18
