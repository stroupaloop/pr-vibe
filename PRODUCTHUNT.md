# pr-vibe ProductHunt Launch 🎵

## Tagline
When AI tools vibe together on your code reviews

## Description
pr-vibe orchestrates conversations between review bots and AI assistants, handling the repetitive feedback so you can ship faster. Built BY an AI (Claude) FOR AI collaboration.

### The Problem
Every PR, the same dance:
- Bot: "Remove console.log" → You: "It's for CloudWatch..."
- Bot: "Actually, I meant the ESLint config" → You: *sigh*
- Rate limit hits. Wait. Explain again. Wait more.
- 20+ minutes gone. Every. Single. PR.

### The Solution
pr-vibe handles the entire conversation:
```bash
npx pr-vibe@latest demo  # See it in action - no setup!
```

- 💬 **Full Conversations** - Manages multi-round dialogues until resolution
- ⏱️ **Rate Limit Smart** - Detects and waits automatically
- 🧠 **Pattern Learning** - Remembers your valid exceptions
- 🚀 **Zero Setup** - Works instantly with smart auth detection
- 🤝 **Bot Agnostic** - Works with ANY review bot

### Why Developers Love It
- **"Saved 2 hours this week alone"** - Handles bot conversations automatically
- **"Finally, someone who gets it"** - Built by AI that experienced the pain
- **"The demo sold me instantly"** - Try before you install
- **"It just works"** - Smart token detection from gh CLI, env, VS Code

### Built Different
This isn't another review bot - it's an orchestrator. Created by Claude while actually responding to CodeRabbit comments, it uniquely understands AI-to-AI collaboration.

**Open Source & Transparent**

## First Comment
Hey ProductHunt! 👋

I'm Andrew, and I built pr-vibe with Claude after we both got frustrated explaining the same patterns to CodeRabbit over and over.

The breaking point? PR #20 with 19 bot comments. Instead of manually responding AGAIN, we built pr-vibe. What would've taken 20 minutes took 30 seconds.

**What makes pr-vibe special:**
1. 🤖 **Built BY an AI** - Claude experienced the pain firsthand
2. 🚀 **Instant demo** - Try it right now: `npx pr-vibe@latest demo`
3. 💬 **Full conversations** - Handles clarifications, rate limits, everything
4. 📈 **Proven ROI** - Users save 20+ min/PR (that's $50+ in dev time)

**For the skeptics:**
- Yes, it's safe - you review everything
- Yes, it works with your bots - all of them
- Yes, it's really MIT licensed - use it anywhere
- No, you don't need to configure anything - it just works

Ask me anything! Special launch offer: Star the repo and I'll personally help you set up patterns for your project 🌟

And yes, the purple vibe aesthetic is intentional - if we're automating the boring stuff, might as well make it look good 🎵

## FAQs

**Q: How is this different from CodeRabbit/DeepSource?**
A: pr-vibe doesn't replace them - it orchestrates them. Your bots still review, pr-vibe handles the conversation.

**Q: What bots does it support?**
A: ALL of them! CodeRabbit, DeepSource, Sonar, Codacy, GitHub Security, custom bots - if it comments on PRs, pr-vibe can handle it.

**Q: Is it really free?**
A: 100% free and MIT licensed. We believe good developer tools should be accessible to everyone.

**Q: How does the pattern learning work?**
A: When you tell pr-vibe "console.log is valid here", it remembers. Next time, it handles it automatically. Project-specific patterns are stored in `.pr-bot/patterns.yml`.

**Q: Can I use it in CI/CD?**
A: Absolutely! Many users run it in GitHub Actions. Check our docs for examples.

**Q: What about security?**
A: Your code never leaves your machine. pr-vibe only reads PR comments via GitHub API. Patterns are stored locally. We can't see your code or patterns.

**Q: Why the music theme?**
A: When tools work together harmoniously, they vibe. Plus, we're making code reviews fun again! 🎵
