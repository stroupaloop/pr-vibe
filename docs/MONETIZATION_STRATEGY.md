# Monetization Strategy for pr-review-assistant

## Philosophy
- Value first, payment optional
- Never gate core features
- Respect developers' time and trust
- Build sustainable, not extractive

## Current Approach (Phase 1)

### 1. GitHub Sponsors
- Set up tiers:
  - 💚 $5/month - "Coffee Tier" - Early supporter badge
  - 🚀 $25/month - "Pizza Tier" - Priority issue response
  - 🏢 $100/month - "Team Tier" - Logo in README

### 2. Buy Me a Coffee
- For one-time "thanks!" 
- Link in CLI after successful review session
- Non-intrusive: `Saved time? ☕ buymeacoffee.com/stroupaloop`

### 3. Polar.sh Issue Funding
- Let users fund specific features
- "Add GitLab support" - $500 bounty
- Transparent and developer-friendly

## Future Opportunities (Phase 2)

### Hosted Service (pr-review.dev)
```
Free Tier:
- Unlimited personal use
- Public repos only
- Community support

Team Tier ($29/month):
- Private repos
- Team dashboard
- Audit logs
- Priority support
```

### Enterprise Features
- Self-hosted version
- Custom LLM endpoints
- Compliance reports
- SLA support

## What NOT to Do
❌ Ads in CLI output
❌ Artificial feature limits
❌ Nagware or guilt trips
❌ Selling user data
❌ Paywalling bug fixes

## Implementation

### In the CLI
```javascript
// After successful review session
if (stats.timeSaved > 30 && Math.random() < 0.1) { // 10% chance
  console.log(chalk.dim(`\n☕ Saved ${stats.timeSaved} minutes? Consider supporting: github.com/sponsors/stroupaloop`));
}
```

### In README
```markdown
## Support

pr-review-assistant is MIT licensed and free forever. If it saves you time:

- ⭐ Star the repo
- 💚 [Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/stroupaloop)
- ☕ [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/stroupaloop)
- 🎯 [Fund a feature](https://polar.sh/stroupaloop)
```

## Success Metrics
- 1% of users become sponsors
- $500-1000/month covers maintenance time
- Enough for annual costs (domains, services)
- Not trying to get rich, just sustainable

## Inspiration
- sindresorhus (excellent sponsor tiers)
- Caleb Porzio (sustainable open source)
- Adam Wathan (free tool → paid service)
