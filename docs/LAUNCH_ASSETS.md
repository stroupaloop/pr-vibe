## FAQ Prep

**Q: Is this replacing CodeRabbit?**
A: No! It works WITH CodeRabbit to handle the repetitive parts. CodeRabbit still catches issues, pr-vibe just handles the responses.

**Q: How is this different from just ignoring bot comments?**
A: pr-vibe actually fixes real issues AND explains why some patterns are valid in your codebase. It's about context, not suppression.

**Q: What did Claude Code actually build?**
A: About 70% of the code, 100% of the vibe, the pattern learning system, the purple gradient, and it insisted on the music emoji.

**Q: Is my code being sent somewhere?**
A: Everything runs locally. Your code never leaves your machine.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! And fun fact - we've already had PRs where the contributor used their AI assistant. It's AI all the way down.
