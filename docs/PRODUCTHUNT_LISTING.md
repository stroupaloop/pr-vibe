### Description
```
Hi Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I built pr-vibe WITH Claude Code after getting frustrated explaining the same things to CodeRabbit for the 100th time.

The story: PR #20 had 19 bot comments. I spent 18 minutes explaining why we use console.log in Lambda functions (CloudWatch!), why some webhooks need 'any' types, and other project-specific patterns.

That's when I asked Claude Code: "Want to solve this together?"

48 hours later, we shipped pr-vibe - a tool that lets AI handle AI feedback intelligently.

âœ¨ What makes it special:
â€¢ Learns YOUR project's patterns (not generic rules)
â€¢ Fixes real issues, explains valid exceptions  
â€¢ Saves ~18 minutes per PR with heavy bot activity
â€¢ Built BY an AI that understands AI frustrations
â€¢ Gets smarter with each use

ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for teams who:
â€¢ Use CodeRabbit, DeepSource, or other PR bots
â€¢ Have project-specific patterns that bots don't understand
â€¢ Want to stay in flow instead of context-switching
â€¢ Believe AI tools should collaborate, not conflict

ðŸ’œ The vibe:
This isn't about suppressing warnings - it's about context. pr-vibe fixes real issues AND explains why certain patterns are valid in YOUR codebase.

ðŸš€ Get started in 60 seconds:
npm install -g pr-vibe
pr-vibe pr YOUR_PR_NUMBER

The twist? Check the git commits - Claude is listed as co-author. This is what human-AI collaboration looks like.

Would love your feedback on both the tool AND the building process!

### First Comment (Pinned)
```
ðŸ§µ Some backstory on building WITH Claude Code:

The fascinating part wasn't just that Claude could code - it was that it had OPINIONS. Strong ones.

- It insisted on the name "pr-vibe" over my boring "pr-bot-responder"
- It designed the purple gradient and wouldn't budge on the color
- It added the ðŸŽµ emoji everywhere (said it represents "harmony between tools")
- It even wrote philosophical comments about "vibe coding" in the codebase

This experiment proved something: AI tools can build solutions for AI collaboration better than we can alone.

Technical details in the README, but the TL;DR: pr-vibe learns your patterns and handles repetitive bot feedback so you can stay in flow.

Built with love (and some frustration) by a human and an AI who were both tired of repetitive PR comments.

## Tips for Success

### Timing
- Post between 12:01 AM - 2:00 AM PST for full day exposure
- Avoid Mondays (too busy) and Fridays (less traffic)
- Tuesday-Thursday optimal

### Engagement Strategy
1. **First 30 minutes**: Respond to EVERY comment
2. **Share strategically**: 3-5 relevant communities max
3. **Update throughout**: "Wow, #3!" creates momentum
4. **Thank supporters**: Build community from day one

### Common Questions Ready
- "How is this different from configuring bots better?" 
- "Does it work with GitLab/Bitbucket?"
- "What did Claude actually build?"
- "Is my code secure?"
- "Can I contribute?"
